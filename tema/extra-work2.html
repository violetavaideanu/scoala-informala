                                <p>The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much 
                                larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting
                                hare (beagling). With a great sense of smell and superior tracking instinct, the
                                beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and
                                foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded.
                                It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.</p>
